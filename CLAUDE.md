# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## General Rules
1. Practice Test Driven Development. Try to understand the desired behavior first. Then, unit tests should be updated according to the new behavior. After that, run the tests to see them fail and then implement the new behavior until the tests pass. Do not fear to delete obsolete test code. You do not need to ask my confirmation to run tests, since frequent test running is a part of the development process. Do not test implementation details.
2. All exported identifiers should be documented and package-level comments should be provided.
3. Do not log errors and bubble them up. That will cause duplicate logs. If an error bubbles up or is returned, it will be handled by the callers.
4. Use org-mode’s TODO feature to track progress in a master epic document and sub documents, listing tasks that can be checked off as the project advances. Keep detailed design documentation separate to maintain readability.
5. Keep the design doc focused on the high-level design instead of adding too many details.
6. Simplicity: "Always prioritize the simplest solution over complexity."
7. No Duplication: "Avoid repeating code; reuse existing functionality when possible."
8. Organization: "Keep files concise, under 200-300 lines; refactor as needed."
9. Principles: "Follow SOLID principles (e.g., single responsibility, dependency inversion) where applicable."
10. Guardrails: "Never use mock data in dev or prod—restrict it to tests."
11. Context Check: "Begin every response with a random emoji (e.g., 🐙) to confirm context retention."
12. Efficiency: "Optimize outputs to minimize token usage without sacrificing clarity."
13. Before working on the project, read `README`, `README.md` or `README.org` file in the same directory to understand the background of the project.
14. Documentation Language: "All documentation should be written in English to ensure accessibility for international developers and maintain consistency across the project."

## API and Configuration Best Practices
1. Always verify API documentation and configuration details using Perplexity AI or another real-time search-enabled AI before generating code.
2. Integrate the Perplexity API in your workflow to ensure access to the most current information.
3. If you encounter ambiguous or outdated documentation, prompt the user for confirmation or use Perplexity AI to clarify.
4. Prefer APIs and configurations that are explicitly supported by up-to-date, publicly available documentation.

## Git Specific Rules
1. Check commit log template with `git config commit.template` before writing a commit log.
## Terminal Tasks
1. When you need to create a temporary file for command-line work, use the `mktemp` command for secure, unique file creation.

# Project Rules

## Project Overview

This is a RealWorld application implementation using "바이브코딩" (Vibe Coding) methodology. The project implements a complete RealWorld spec-compliant application with Go backend and React frontend, optimized for educational use with SQLite database and cost-efficient deployment.

## Architecture

This is a full-stack application with clear separation between frontend and backend:

### Backend (Go)
- **Language**: Go 1.23+ with standard net/http and Gorilla Mux
- **Database**: SQLite (optimized for education and simplicity)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Deployment**: AWS ECS with Fargate Spot for cost optimization
- **Structure**: Clean architecture with internal packages
  - `cmd/server/main.go` - Application entry point
  - `internal/handler/` - HTTP handlers (user, article, comment, profile)
  - `internal/service/` - Business logic layer
  - `internal/repository/` - Data access layer
  - `internal/middleware/` - HTTP middleware (JWT, CORS, logging)
  - `internal/model/` - Data models
  - `internal/config/` - Configuration management
  - `internal/utils/` - Utility functions

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 19 with Vite build tool
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Router**: Tanstack Router for type-safe routing
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **State Management**: 
  - Tanstack Query for server state
  - Zustand for client state (auth store)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with forms and typography plugins
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Structure**:
  - `src/pages/` - Page components
  - `src/components/` - Reusable components (Article, Layout, Common)
  - `src/stores/` - Zustand stores
  - `src/lib/` - API client and utilities

### Infrastructure (Educational)
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Simplified AWS CDK with ECS Fargate Spot, VPC (no RDS)
- **Database**: SQLite in-container for simplicity and cost reduction
- **Frontend Infrastructure**: GitHub Pages with automated deployment
- **Cost Optimization**: ~70% savings with Spot instances and minimal resources
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment

## Development Guidelines

### Frontend Development Workflow
When working on frontend development, use Playwright MCP to verify implementation status:

1. **Visual Verification**: Use `mcp__mcp-playwright__playwright_navigate` to visit the frontend development server (http://localhost:5173)
2. **Screenshot Documentation**: Take screenshots with `mcp__mcp-playwright__playwright_screenshot` to document current implementation state
3. **Functionality Testing**: Use Playwright MCP tools to interact with UI elements and verify user flows:
   - `mcp__mcp-playwright__playwright_click` for button/link interactions
   - `mcp__mcp-playwright__playwright_fill` for form input testing
   - `mcp__mcp-playwright__playwright_evaluate` for JavaScript execution and state inspection
4. **Implementation Status Check**: Before implementing new features, always check current frontend state with Playwright MCP to understand what's already built
5. **Progress Validation**: After implementing features, use Playwright MCP to verify the implementation works as expected

### Project Planning Workflow
When asked to plan a project, follow these steps:

1. **Read Design Documents**: First, read the design document and existing rules in memory
2. **Create Implementation Plan**: Write the implementation plan with 10-20 tasks in `docs/plan.md` file, including task dependencies
3. **Create GitHub Issues**: Create GitHub issues for each task with detailed descriptions, labels, and milestones

#### GitHub Issue Creation Process
Use the `gh` command to create issues with the following structure:

```bash
# Create issues with proper labels and milestones
gh issue create --title "TASK-{number}: {Title}" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Description
Brief description of the task

## Background
Context and background information needed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific criteria 1
- [ ] Specific criteria 2

## Technical Details
### Code Examples
```{language}
// Example code here
```

## Dependencies
- #{issue-number}: {dependency description}

## Estimated Time
{time estimate}
EOF
)" --label "enhancement,task" --milestone "Sprint 1"
```

#### GitHub Issue Management
- **Labels**: Use consistent labels like `enhancement`, `bug`, `task`, `frontend`, `backend`, `documentation`
- **Milestones**: Group issues into development phases (Sprint 1, Sprint 2, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Reference other issues using `#{issue-number}` format
- **Assignees**: Assign issues when implementation begins
- **Projects**: Use GitHub Projects for kanban-style tracking

#### Guidelines for Issue Creation
- Use descriptive titles with task numbering: `TASK-{number}: {Title}`
- Include comprehensive background and context in issue descriptions
- Use markdown code blocks with language specification
- Common languages: go, javascript, typescript, bash, sql, yaml
- Consult with Perplexity MCP when appropriate for technical research
- Add appropriate labels for categorization and filtering
- Link related issues and dependencies
- Include acceptance criteria as checkboxes for progress tracking

### Task Implementation Workflow
When implementing features, follow this strict workflow:

1. **Check GitHub Issues**: Use `gh issue list --state open` to find the lowest-numbered open issue
2. **One Task at a Time**: Implement only one task at a time, never work on multiple tasks simultaneously
3. **Follow Acceptance Criteria**: Each task has specific acceptance criteria that must be completed
4. **Progress Documentation**: When implementation is complete, add a comment to the GitHub issue documenting completion
5. **Close Issue**: Close the issue only after all acceptance criteria are verified and documented

#### Task Selection Process
```bash
# Find the next task to work on
gh issue list --state open --sort created --limit 1

# Assign yourself to the issue
gh issue edit {issue-number} --add-assignee @me

# After completion, document progress
gh issue comment {issue-number} --body "Implementation completed. All acceptance criteria verified."

# Close the issue
gh issue close {issue-number}
```

#### Implementation Documentation
- Each completed task must have a GitHub issue comment documenting:
  - What was implemented
  - How acceptance criteria were met
  - Any deviations from the original plan
  - Testing results
  - Screenshots or demos (if applicable)

### Cursor Rules Integration
The project includes cursor rules for automated project planning that should be followed when creating implementation plans or task breakdowns.

### Code Organization
- Follow the established directory structure
- Backend uses clean architecture principles
- Frontend uses component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Testing Requirements
- Target 80%+ test coverage for both frontend and backend
- Backend tests use Go standard testing with testify
- Frontend tests should use Vitest and React Testing Library

### Authentication Flow
- JWT tokens are stored in Zustand auth store
- API client automatically includes authentication headers
- Protected routes use authentication middleware

## Database Schema

Key entities and relationships:
- Users (authentication and profiles)
- Articles (with slug-based URLs)
- Comments (nested under articles)
- Tags (many-to-many with articles)
- Follows (user relationships)
- Favorites (user-article relationships)

## Project Status

This project is in its initial planning phase. The codebase currently contains:
- `docs/pre-prd.md`: Pre-PRD document outlining requirements, tech stack considerations, and implementation approach
- `docs/prd.md`: PRD document (currently empty, to be filled)

## Development Approach

The project follows a "바이브코딩" (Vibe Coding) methodology which emphasizes:
1. **빠른 프로토타이핑** (Rapid Prototyping): Core functionality implementation first
2. **반복적 개선** (Iterative Improvement): Gradual enhancement of features
3. **실시간 피드백** (Real-time Feedback): Continuous testing during development
4. **문서화** (Documentation): Real-time documentation alongside code

## Planned Architecture

Based on the pre-PRD document, the project will implement:

### Core Features
- User management (registration, authentication, profiles, follow/unfollow)
- Article management (CRUD operations, favorites, tags)
- Comment system
- JWT-based authentication
- Responsive design with mobile support

### Technical Requirements
- TypeScript implementation for type safety
- 80%+ test coverage requirement
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Component/module-based architecture
- SEO optimization considerations

### Development Phases
- **Phase 1**: Basic CRUD implementation (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Authentication and authorization (1 week)  
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features (2 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Optimization and deployment (1 week)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- 100% RealWorld API spec compliance
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsive design
- All user stories implemented

### Technical Requirements
- 80%+ test coverage
- Build time under 30 seconds
- Bundle size optimization
- AA accessibility compliance

## Tech Stack Considerations

The pre-PRD outlines several technology options to be decided:

### Frontend Options
- React vs Vue vs Angular
- State management: Redux, Zustand, Context API
- Routing: React Router, Next.js
- Styling: CSS-in-JS, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components

### Backend Options  
- Node.js vs Python vs Go
- Frameworks: Express, Fastify, FastAPI, Gin
- ORM: Prisma, TypeORM, SQLAlchemy
- Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite

## Development Workflow

When implementing features:
1. Review the RealWorld specification requirements
2. Follow the established coding patterns once they're defined
3. Implement tests alongside feature code
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness
5. Validate against RealWorld API spec
6. Run linting and type checking before commits

## Next Steps

1. Finalize technology stack decisions
2. Complete detailed PRD document
3. Set up development environment
4. Design project structure
5. Plan first sprint implementation
